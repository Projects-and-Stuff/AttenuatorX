# AttenuatorX and AttenuatorXLE #
#### Wide-Band, Large Attenuation, Medium Power, Digitally Adjustable RF Attenuators ####

This project grew out of dissatisfaction for products currently on the market. As part of my job as a Radar Technician, I needed an attenuator that could handle up to around 40 dBm, provide a variety of attenuation levels, and operate over a large frequency spectrum. The only devices I found that met these needs cost over $2000, and are adjusted physically over 1 dB increments. I thought I could do better, so I started working on doing just that. Please feel free to join me if you're interested by forking my project and requesting a merge for any improvements you add.

**AttenuatorXLE** is a low-cost Digitally adjustable attenuator which will be the first of two devices developed. It will offer the following preliminary specifications:

* 10 to 41 dB Attenuation in 0.5 dB Steps
* 50 MHz to 3 GHz Operation
* Up to 36 dBm Input Power
